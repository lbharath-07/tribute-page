        <p id="b">Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi, Dhoni dared to dream and with courage and guts
       make that dream a reality. Since a very young age, he idolized Sachin Tendulkar who is known           
       as the God of Cricket and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan. He started his career as a Ticket 
        Collector in Indian Railways. His hard work and never-give-up spirit finally landed him in International Cricket in 2003.
        Nobody expected India to win and making Dhoni the captain was a mere formality by the board who themselves knew that fate of the team.
         But what they dint knew was the turnaround that was coming for Indian cricket which was in turmoil after the first round exit from the 
         ICC Cricket World Cup in 2007. Dhoni’s India won the World cup. More than the Victory it was the belief that was important which he filled 
         in the team that they can perform and win against the best in any conditions. Since then he took Indian cricket to new height demolishing 
         every record as a batsmen and as a captain.Then came 2011, the cricketing carnival was about to start, the expectation and the hopes of becoming 
         the 50 over World Champions for the second time were on the new heights.

        <p class="card-text"><big>I</big>nsufficient to describe the stature of the jewel of Indian cricket, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The journey from being an ordinary
            ticket collector in a small town of Kharagpur to the most successful Indian captain has been nothing short of extraordinary for him.
            The former Indian skipper has been on the national duty carrying the burden of over 1 billion expectation for over a decade now.
             Being responsible for the joy and happiness of a country in which cricket is just not a game, a country where cricketers are considered
              as God, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has lived up to their expectation every time he has stepped onto the field. The incredible success he has
               achieved during the process is unprecedented and something he can really be proud of. But the glory for him has not been that easy as
                he went through several hardships for achieving the same which makes him a role model for people who give up their their dreams far too 
                soon. Dhoni has been an inspiration for all, motivating people to chase their dream even if the path is full of obstacles</p>
        
    <h3 style=" text-align:center;font-family: Georgia, serif;">Becoming a Sensation and Captaincy</h3>
    

    <p>Today Indian team is considered as the most dominant team in the world when compared to 2011, when Geoffrey Boycott compared the Indian side to Alsatian 
        and the reason for the transformation is one and only Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who gave numerous opportunities to players like Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan
         to built up his own team, a team that has dominates the world Cricket now. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not the captain anymore nor he is the player he used to
          be but his name is still enough to sends a wave of fear in the opposition camp. Some people have forgotten his contribution but still the majority stand 
          tall with him. “Legacy is not what’s left tomorrow when you are gone, it’s what you give, create, impact and contribute today while you are here that then 
          happens to live on.” M.S. Dhoni surely seems to believe in this mantra. His unparalleled legacy and character is an inspiration to all.</p>
